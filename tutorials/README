1) Checkout the develop_v2
> git clone https://github.com/ALPSCore/CT-HYB.git
> git checkout develop_v2

2) Build the code (cmake options are the same as the old one)

3) In the repository you have checked out, you will see two examples. For the Hubbard atom, you can generate input files and run the code as follows.
> cd CT-HYB/tutorials/hubbard_atom
> sbatch job.sh # Inside the job script, you can see how it works

4) Evaluate the self-energy from QMC data in the output file
>  python3 ../read_sigma.py input 100
In the above, we evaluate the self-energy for 100 positive and 100 negative frequencies.
Then, the evaluated result will be stored in input_sigma_iw.txt.

The input parameters for the new code are slightly different from the old one.

1) "model.spin" and “model.sites" have retired.
2) “model.flavors” has been introduced (, which is equal to 2 * num of orbitals)
3) We do not have to specify the number of Matsubara frequencies because the self-energy can be evaluated with an arbitrary number of frequencies in the post processing.
